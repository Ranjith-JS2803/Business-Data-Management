# Business-Data-Management
## Capstone Project

- This project completely depends on data analysis , where data was collected from a hotel explaining about the project and use of providing the data.
- The data stored were in daily basis using Microsoft Excel , which contains only the item names along with their selling price and revenue.
- I had to use some data cleansing techniques to use it for analysis.

### Analysis :

1. Pareto Analysis
    * Revenue Pareto
    * Sales Pareto
2. Revenue Trend
    * Date wise Revenue Trend
    * Day wise Revenue Trend
    * Revenue Growth
3. BU Analysis
    *  Highest Revenue

### Recommendations :
- Can increase selling price of high sales items.
- Food parcels could be provided with discounts and combo offers 
to attract customers.
- As customers in the locality where the hotel is located prefer 
parottas most , Hotel can ensure that customers know that there 
are different types of dishes made using parotta [As most dishes 
made using parotta have less sales].

### Working :
- Analyses are done using Microsoft Excel.
- ```Pivot table``` is used for aggregation.
- ```VLOOKUP Function``` is used to lookup data from other spreadsheets.
- Analyses are done in ```Workings.xlsx```

### Presentation :
- Presentation is shared as ```Presentation.pptx```
